### RandomBreak

**RandomBreak** brings chaos and fun to Minecraft! Every block you break drops a completely random item from the game. Mine a stone block? You might get a diamond, a cake! Every block is a surprise, making survival unpredictable and exciting.

### Features

- Any block you break (stone, dirt, ore, etc.) drops a random item.
- Fully compatible with vanilla Minecraft and other mods.
- Lightweight and easy to install.

For the mod to work, it is not necessary for all players to install it. You need to download the mod only for the server (or the player who opens the world according to it).
