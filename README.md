## Features

- **Randomness**: Break any block (stone, dirt, ore) and get a random item from Minecraft's vast item pool.
- **Vanilla-Friendly**: Seamlessly works with vanilla Minecraft and most other mods.
- **Server-Side**: Only the server (or the player hosting the world) needs the mod installed—perfect for multiplayer chaos!

This mod is perfect for players who crave a fresh, unpredictable challenge. Whether you're a speedrunner looking to test your adaptability or a casual player wanting to spice up survival, **RandomBreak** delivers endless surprises. Can you beat the game when every block is a gamble?
